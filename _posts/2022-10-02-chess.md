**Dependencies**
- Java 17.0.2

**Summary**
- A simple two player terminal based chess game, that uses different object oriented patterns
- I built this project to better understand object oriented programming, in which I use...
    - Abstract Classes to define the piece class, in which each type of piece inherits from
    - Interfaces to determine what methods each piece should be able to have
    - Inheritance to demonstrate similarities between pieces. EX: King can move in all the same directions as the Queen
- Supports checkmate, castling, promotion

**To Play**
- In order to move a piece, separate the origin position to the destination position
    - Ex: ("e4 e5")
    - If not a legal move, you will be prompted again
